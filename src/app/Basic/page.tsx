     <h2><b>How GMOs are made?</b></h2>
     <p>GMOs are made by altering the genetic material of organisms using techniques like gene splicing and gene editing to enhance desired traits</p><br />
     
     <h2><b>Genitically modified crops</b></h2>
     
   
     <p><b>Corn</b>:Genetically modified to resist pests and tolerate herbicides, making it easier to grow in large quantities.</p>
   
     <p> <b>Soyabeans</b>:Engineered for herbicide resistance, commonly used in food products, animal feed, and biofuels.</p>
    
     <p><b>Cotton</b>:Modified to resist insects and reduce pesticide use, widely used in textiles and cottonseed oil.</p>
     
     <p><b>Canola</b>:Genetically altered to tolerate herbicides, primarily used in cooking oils and animal feed.</p>
